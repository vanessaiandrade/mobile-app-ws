# MOBILE-APP-WS

I completed a project using a tutorial that guided me in building my first RESTful web service application using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA. Implemented some features, included:

* User registration and login using Spring Security
* Email verification
* Password reset
* API call to get user details
* API call to get a list of users and implement Pagination
* Update and delete user information through API calls  

## What did I learn?

* How to use Amazon AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to send and validate user email addresses, and how to generate and include the JSON Web Token in an HTTP Request.

* I successfully navigated Postman, a versatile HTTP client software, to send various types of requests such as POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT. I also used Postman HTTP client software to send: POST, GET, DELETE and PUT requests, as well as how to set the necessary HTTP headers.
